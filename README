Simple command-line tool for basic management of Apache's virtual hosts (vh).

Currently supports creation, deletion, enabling\disabling, backuping and restoring of vh and data.

Also this tool can backup virtual host configs as well as the data of www folders.

A bit customizable (see config). For all options and commands run 'vhost -h'
