Simple command-line tool for basic management of Apaches virtual hosts (vh).

Currently supports creation, deletion, enabling or disabling, backuping and restoring of vh and data.

Also this tool can backup virtual host configs as well as the data of www folders.

A bit customizable (see config). For all options and commands run:
 vhost -h

Options could be combined to get extra functionaly.

Examples:
 vhost -cm --db-create-user test
(will create virtual host test (-c), create database test (-m) and db use with the same name. (local domain zone (eg. test.loc, test.lan is defined in config))

 vhost -pmfb test
(will delete vhost (-p), drop database (-m) and remove www files (-f).
 Before deletion, backups will be created (-b))

 vhost -e test
 vhost -d test
(will enable or disable vhost)

INSTALLATION:
 1. unpack archive
 2. run ./install.sh
 3. enjoy!

FUTURE PLANS:
 1. add ability to create VCS repos
 2. support of other database servers
 3. bind9 configuration

NOTE
use it only on local machine (for example, php development).

NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE!
